## Problem

In number theory, the function tau is defined as:
    
    T(n) = The number of divisors of n,

This function is also called the divisor function.

Your task is to compute this function for a series of input numbers.


### Input
The first line consists of the number of test cases T. The following T lines each contain a number N - the input to the tau function.

### Output
For each of the input number, print the output of the tau function in a separate line.

### Time Limit
```
1.0000000 sec
```

### Constraints
```
0 < T <= 5000
0 <= N <= 10^12
```

### Examples

Input:

```
2
3
10
```

Output:

```
2
4
```

#### Explanation:
For the first test case, the input number is 3. The output is tau(3) = 2 since 3 has only two divisors - 1 and itself.
Similarly, 10 has 4 divisors - 1, 2, 5, 10.
